<p>Hello. My name is Vaibhav Gowda. I am from Bethlehem, PA. I am a sophomore at Texas A&M University. I have developed this webpage for ISTM 210 by Theresa Phinney. The purpose of this webpage is to put myself in the real world and get real world experience with databases. <a>.
I am majoring in Management Information Systems from Mays Business School at Texas A&M University <a> </p>
<p>I like working with databases as well as creating queries and reports off of them. I also work with programming languages such as C++, Java, Python, etc. I am an Eagle Scout. Last year, I was on a research team with 3 other people as we researched about the security issues of Internet of Things (IoT). After I graduate, my dream is to be a data scientist and create reports from a lot of clustered data.</p>
<p>I enjoy watching sports and playing the piano in my free time. </p>
